# devmode7.net

This is a repository with Sculpin datafiles of devmode7.net website.

devmode7 website is dedicated to keeping records of all available data related
to retro-programming. By retro-programming I understand programming old
computers, consoles and other similar platforms.

The idea behind that came to me when I wanted to learn GameBoy programming,
found some link hubs, but lots of websites that were linked were already
non-existant. Because of this I want to preserve as many materials as I can.

This website does not intend to infringe any copyrights. It will collect
materials available freely on the Internet, pointing to an author when
he or she is provided. At any moment the author's takedown notice will be
respected.
